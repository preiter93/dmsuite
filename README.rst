=======

A collection of spectral collocation differentiation matrices for rust.
The current version supports chebdif and fourdif + 
the FFT based counterparts chebdifft and fourdifft.

This collection is based on the python version `DMSUITE-Python`__.
The original version is a matlab/octave collection from Weidemann and Reddy and available from `DMSUITE`__.  The theory and examples are
explained in their paper: J. A. C. Weidemann and S. C. Reddy, A MATLAB
Differentiation Matrix Suite, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 26,
(2000): 465-519.
